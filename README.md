To run the app

Flutter Clean (To clean the flutter dependencies)

Flutter pub get (To install all the required dependencies)

Flutter run (To run the flutter app)


I havent tested it in IOS device, as I am using Window laptop and dont have access to Xcode.(sorry)

App demo recording : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmlwjsRpjtZV45-ITB8o-6dWfyLfvqf8/view?usp=sharing

I am also refactoring the code to Clean architecture in refractor/flutter-clean-architecture branch, where I am seperating the concerns between Data, Domain, and presentation layers, Also using get_it for dependency injection for clean and robust code.
